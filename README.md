# Wireshark-Capture-Analyzer
A tiny Java app I made in an evening in order to analyze Wireshark dump data.

The purpose of this app is to take in raw Wireshark capture data from a variety of locations and times and return information on which devices (by MAC code) were seen in multiple locations, as well as the frequency of each device manufacturer/type seen (using the MAC manufacturer prefixes).  It's not very elegant and could definitely use refinement, but it was just meant to be used the one time.
